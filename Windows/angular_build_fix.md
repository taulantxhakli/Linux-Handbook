# Angular Build Error Fix

As per Microsoft fashion, nothing is ever told to you. So, I am here to fill in that gap.

## Requirements:
- .NET
- Node.js
- Angular (latest)

If on a virtual machine, or a computer that has the policy confused, you can fix the issue with either Node.js or Angular not installing by using this `RemoteSigned` fix.

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned â€“Scope CurrentUser
```
